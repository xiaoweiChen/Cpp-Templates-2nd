Programs are generally constructed using design patterns that map relatively well on the mechanisms offered by a chosen programming language. Because templates introduce a whole new language mechanism, it is not surprising to find that they call for new design elements. We explore these elements in this part of the book. Note that several of them are covered or used by the C++ standard library.
